### Server logs

<!--
Please note:

1.  Logs may help to understand what exactly went wrong.
2.  Problems are often caused not on client but on server-side.
3.  Anonymize your logs properly. Do not post any passwords/secrets/private data.
4.  Make sure i-doit's own logging is enabled.
5.  Paste only excerpts from the logs which seem to be useful for further investigation.
